Regardless, I'm going to show him tonight that I can still pull it up... because he was confused about how it could say he was online when all he did was delete a notification.  So I need to show him that it says ONLINE TODAY.  \n",

He's paranoid and expressing that by being super controlling.  A therapist might be the way to go, you could go together once or twice and he could go alone as well.  He needs some help in dealing with this kind of behavior/these feelings.\n",

The passive-aggressive comments and gaslighting and putting you down is just assholey to the max. You don't deserve to be treated like that no matter what you look like. \n",

He would start a job every couple of months and get super excited about it for a week or two, then he would start to hate it and quit or stop showing up.  It was so different from the person I knew him to be in college.  He always had a job and he was interested in his studies and graduated on time.\n",

      "Maybe there's underlying issues that either he hasn't come to terms with or that he's afraid to face since his behavior seems so out of the ordinary for him.  All I can say is don't regret enabling someone to mooch off of you - I still get mad at myself for not taking a stand and paying for him to essentially be a bum.\n",

You can take it a step further, and play the 'politely confused' game. \"I'm sorry, what do you mean by that?\" Or \"Can you help me understand why my weight is so important to you?\" Or if someone calls you fat: \"why did you call me fat? Can you help me understand your intention behind that comment?\" Put rude people on the spot and ask them to explain their behaviour, and they wig the fuck out.

Trying to provoke a reaction from you when you didn't give him the one he expected, if you see what I mean. It may have hurt his pride somewhat - he was probably expecting tears and pleading, not rational conversation.\n",

If you want to put it behind you, that means that right this second, you don't get to bring it up.  No asking for details, no using it as a trump card in arguments, it's gone.

Don't be afraid of grieving for the loss of the great guy (even though it wasn't who he was), just be sure to get your dancing shoes on and celebrate ditching the asshole as well. Your time is worth more than him. \n",
      "Why is this even a post on here? The answer is obvious. He's a fucking loser. Dump him or join him in Loserville. I don't even know why you want to marry someone like this. He can't even fend for himself. Why do you think he'll be a good partner? This relationship sounds like a nightmare.\n",

This man should have his life together and I know that it's a shitty shitty thing to have to think about, because your heart is hurting any way you look at it, but everyone has it pretty right on when they say 5 years is too long for a 35 year old man to make a permanent decision about his life.

Why did he not introduce you when you ran into them ex and daughter at the mall? (How is that even possible? Did he shove you to the side or leave you behind when he talked to them?) 3. Why does he have to \"walk on egg shells\" when discussing his daughter?  I can't stop talking about my child and it took me all of about 9 months to a year to introduce my baby to my now SO.  He is taking an active role in her life and we will be celebrating 2 years together on Valentine's Day.  This whole situation is shady at best and I say pack up and ship out.

Like I said, I doubt he was doing this to spite you. Make him aware of your expectations in a calm way, and trust in the future he'll remember them.

      "And here's the kicker: once you have confidence behind you, you'll see through this kind of crap before you get really involved and you'll find it easier to say \"Yeahhhh, no, this guy is a jerk and isn't worth my time.\" OR you'll feel like you're worried for nothing because you know what you have to offer and that any guy would be lucky to have you (and any guy who would blow it is a moron). Confidence seems to be the key to having a well-tuned \"picker.\"\n",

      "I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way - it's not your fault that he's a jerk, and it's not your fault that you're feeling this way.

However, you will save yourself so much heartache later on if you put your own happiness first and let the rest follow. \n",

Definitely try though. 13 years is a lot to \"throw away.\" If you give it your everything then at least you can end it knowing you did everything possible and it wasn't you. \n",

Hoping he turns over a new leaf? Those are all reasons that many girls in your situation would use to rationalize getting back together, but this dude in the end will poison you.\n",
      "Then just try and keep half a lid on it till you have your ring. The first thing people will ask is to see it, so you'll have to just leap about privately then be calm in public. February will be here before you know it. \n",

      "Yes, it's abuse. \n",

      "What you said is correct, he does not respect you. You're definitely not overreacting and you have every right to say no. You need to give him an ultimatum: either he stops doing that, learns to take you seriously, or you'll have to take serious steps backwards in this relationship.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm willing to bet that if his male friends told him it was wrong, he might finally understand. It seems to me he doesn't respect your opinion. \n",

      "Why are you worried about who is to blame?  The only thing you should be worried about is how to make the relationship one he wants to stay in.  Clearly it already is one you want to stay in.\n",
      "Haha this is the best story I've read in this sub ever. Usually I'm in agreement that you should avoid fighting if possible, but I think you fucking rocked it man! Reminds me of a movie. He was an ass hole that was threatening you. He deserved to get his ass kicked. What's to say he would stop harassing you if you just blocked his number? Now he will always remember you punching him in the face. I don't think he will press charges like everyone is afraid of. Not everyone that gets in a fight goes to jail. He's obviously a meat head that cares about his tough guy persona. So hopefully this is the end of it and you don't get in trouble.\n",

      "\n",
      "The last sentence is key. You're right. You're just right. But it's not something I can say, you know, over the phone. So I have to do it the next time I see him, which makes prolonging the relationship we have now as easy as it is fun as it is a little painful. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last time I tried to tell him how I feel, I said just enough to feel like I had closure, and I was proud of myself for that. Somehow it had the opposite effect, and I guess I piqued his interest in me (again?)....\n",

      "Oh girl... To be honest with you that doesn't sound too good. A part of getting sober is changing people, places, and things. This includes his job (since it has so much drinking associated with it). If he's not willing to let go of it, it doesn't sound like he's willing to really change his life around to stay sober. I still go to five meetings a week (female, by the way). \n",

      "\n",
      "I loved my boyfriend when I was drinking, but I loved the effects of alcohol even more. I HAD to drink. I didn't know how to stop. Once I became willing to change my life around, I started to get better... The kicker is that I had to go through enough pain to have that willingness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll seriously be thinking about you. Your post hit me really hard. I cheated on my boyfriend when I was drinking. He was so good to me. I can't make amends to him, either. He's married and it wouldn't be appropriate. More harm than good to contact him just so I can feel a burden lifted. \n",

      "Like I said... Don't give up hope!!! But if he becomes unwilling to put the bottle down I suggest letting the relationship go. It will cause you way more harm than good.

I can't see any of your issue resolving on there own.  Your sex drive will most likely always be higher than his.  He will likely always want his own space.  I would advise you to consider if you will be happy spending your life with him *as he is now*.   \n",

We all spend a lot to contribute, so you need to either pitch in with stuff or toward costs.\" Why on earth did you let him dominate game night time and time again without ever saying something? \"Hey, AnnoyingGuy, we're playing Catan tonight. It doesn't seem like your thing, so we're going to do this game ourselves and then you want to jump in for the next one?\" Finally, after things got to the breaking point and he was told he wasn't welcome at the game (which, why on earth are you still holding it at that apartment? *he lives there*. is there not a single one of you else who could host it) why on earth did you (again, you all) choose to openly mock and insult him instead of saying something at the beginning of the game? I'm not saying he would have taken any of those statements well, but his bad behavior is on him, but that doesn't change the fact that speaking up was the right thing to do, and instead you chose not to do it. Your bad behavior is on you. \n",

In the post though, you can tell he didnt \"let her have it\" until they were already discussing it.  This issue is a lot like the \"please and thank you\" thing he mentioned above.

If he can't listen to your boundaries, he can't be naked with you. You have to put your actions/words where your feelings are and leave no room for doubt that this is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable behavior. It might also be wise to, in the beginning gestures of sex, take his face in both hands, make eye contact, and remind him that any butt-play is not okay. Cut it off at the pass.

Communication in relationships is super important, as long as you focus on how you feel and don't accuse the other person, and as long as you attempt to be calm and willing to listen. It's just that at some point, you have to accept what he tells you. I hope it works out for you two though!\n",

I was also diagnosed with ADHD as a child, and now I'm in my mid-20s, unmedicated, in school with a high GPA, and able to manage my own finances pretty well. You have ADHD, you're medicated, and you're able to budget and plan and hold down a successful job. So I don't think it's fair to make excuses for him or blame his bad decisions on his disorder when a.) he's medicated, b.) it's clear that some of us are just fine. Sure, maybe it's harder for us to remember things or not make impulsive decisions, but these things can be compensated for with good habits and coping mechanisms and I don't see him making that effort, according to what you've written here. He's acting like an overgrown child more than an adult who's ready to be a father.\n",

He might not be willing/able to change, and if that's the case you need to ask yourself if you're willing to stay and have kids with an incredibly irresponsible person, or if you'd be better off dumping him and finding someone who can actually act like an adult.\n",

He would ignore that part of my identity, change the subject if it came up, and call any girlfriends my \"friend\" no matter what.

If he doesn't show up but keeps calling and texting and messaging, call the cops anyway, explain your situation and ask if one of them can give him a call to warn him of the dangers of his behavior.

When I was younger and more afraid, less sure of myself and the law, I let some guys harass me until they tired themselves out. By the time it was over, I was worn down each time and had to take a long hiatus from dating or interacting with men to stabilize and readjust my mind to realize not all men are creepy, self-centered bastards.

Every time he lies to you, even if it's the dumbest, most pointless lie on earth, it drips on you, eroding your ability to have faith that what he says is true.

At this point you've both established that your normal sexual encounters revolve around him, whenever he pleases, and in a very unfair ratio. That needs to change. You don't have to make a big deal about it, you don't even have to mention it. He wants to have sex? Foreplay first. He would like head? So would you. And so on and so forth.

You did exactly what I did. It happens so easily. There's so much warmth, so much comfort, so much beauty in the safety of what you have. Why reach for more if you feel like you have everything you need? But my lesson here is not just to have a parachute in case things turn ugly. Imagine doing more things on your own aswell?

I didn't grow up on a farm, but I've always been under the impression that when that decision comes, should the decision be available, it's always the farmer's decision.  In this case, she was your animal so it was your decision.  I feel like some silent farmer's code should have made him realize that he has no right to make the decision about your animal for you.  You said he's still your boyfriend (read not husband with legal rights to your property) and this was several years ago so there should still have a clear line of your things and his things.  I don't think his upbringing has any bearing on this.\n",

This could apply to anything that is yours that you care for.  He decided you weren't making the correct decision so he made it for you.  He could have felt you were wrong, but he never had to do anything about it.  He actively chose to go above you and make this decision.  This decision happened to end a life that can never be recovered.  That's a much bigger decision than throwing out an item he things is useless.  It's a big deal.\n",

What motivated him to hide it then if he was so high on the ideal that he did the right thing?  He hid it because he KNEW it was wrong.  Even as he did it, he knew it was wrong and would hurt you and HE STILL DID IT.  You never suspected a thing because you trust him.  So now, aren't you curious what else he did behind your back that you never suspected?  You told us this is the only thing he's really done in 7 years, but the truth is you actually don't know because if he hadn't told you, you still wouldn't know.  What has he done since?  Was someone about to rat him out to you so he beat them to the punch?  Why did he tell you now?  It's even more alarming that he did this to \"help you feel better/be less stressed.\"  Really?  He thought this was the best way to make you feel better?  My question is, did you feel less stressed?  Did he ever say, well at least you don't have to worry about her messes anymore?  He freaking lied to your face when he denied doing anything to her too.  That doesn't sound like someone who feels they made a mistake, that sounds like someone who was manipulating you.  It sounds more like, she comes home and cleans up messes instead of spending her time with me.  She is too upset to do things I want to do.  I will get rid of the thing competing for attention. \n",

There had to be other things before and after he was doing behind your back.  So what happens to other things that compete for your attention.  When your kids grow up, if one of them gets rebellious during the teen years, is he just going to enroll them in military school?  boarding school?  call the cops on them?  He doesn't have respect for a living creature you loved.  The jump between pet and person should be bigger, but will it?  These are all things you need to think about.  You loved that cat which means you probably think of pets as more than just animals you care for.  He knew that and he removed something you loved to better his position in your life.

Cheating implies that you're doing something you know is not okay, or doing something that is clearly expressed as off limits. It doesn't sound like you entirely know his feelings on it, nor did you cuddle with the guy knowing what you were doing was wrong. That doesn't mean what you did was okay necessarily, just that I personally wouldn't brand it as cheating. If he tells you to not do it again and you do then that would be cheating. \n",

I don't think it's fair, however, that so many people are saying he's not into you or he's gay for his roommates or whatever.

If it doesn't work out then at least you haven't exposed yourself to any unnecessary health or pregnancy risk, or made a relationship out to be more than what it should be.  He's obviously not ready yet, and the circumstances certainly don't make it easy.  If this is the right guy, it will be worth the bullshit.  If it's not worth the bullshit, he might not be the one.

Now I'v moved on with my life and I'm so much happier with my current boyfriend than I ever was before. I promise it gets easier.

I did a lot of the housework but I expected him to help out, especially on weekends because I was taking 18-22 hour semesters to get done as soon as possible and I did not have the time or energy to do everything.

I have also given up the gym and a lot of my hobbies due to exhaustion but I keep reminding myself that this is temporary.

It will help you leave work at work and you can focus on home when you're at home. As for healthy meals, the crockpot is your friend. I take an hour or so to make up batches of soups and whatnot and toss them in the freezer. The night before, I take something out and then I toss it in the crockpot before I leave the house in the morning. You can also have your husband do this--for example, when I made ham and lentil soup the other week, I had masking tape on the lid that said to add 1 c of water and the container of chicken stock in the pantry--put in crockpot and leave on low all day. You save a shitton of money and time. Yes, you eat a lot of soup but soup is fucking delicious. Doing things that are reminiscent of what you want really helps you feel a lot better. \n",

It's brutal to be gone all day at this shitty, awful job that I am trapped in and come home and have to make dinner and do chores because by the time I am done with doing everything that needs to be done, it's time for bed and then it just starts all over. I just want 30 minutes or an hour to unwind without having to worry about getting everything done around the house that needs to be done. I know you're working hard but I am too. Just because I am tired doesn't mean that things don't need to be done and I am feeling like if I don't do it or badger you about doing it, it won't get done and that makes me feel very alone in this marriage. You're staying up late, sleeping in and spending a lot of time around the house and it's hard for me not to be mad or resentful because you expect me to carry a big chunk of the household stuff in addition to locking myself into this shitty, awful job. I know it's almost over but I am asking you to please, please help me out more. Take down the stupid Xmas tree, clean the kitchen, go to the grocery store--I'll help but I need you to help me out a bit more.

No, I'm not kidding. That relationship didn't last long. It's a dealbreaker, and your SO is a bigot. If he was racist and hated anyone who wasn't the same ethnicity as him, would you put up with it? Nope. \n",

      "Totally that girl here. My boyfriend had a full beard for a few months before he had to report for service with the Army. I LOVED his beard.

We call our relationship a team-- we are always each other's first priority, first person to communicate big news to, the first person we go to if there's a problem or we need support (ie his dad has prostate cancer, he comes to me to talk about it instead of his best friend, I talk to him if I have a problem at work, etc.), etc. We are a team and we consistently put each other first. \n",

      "When he shaved his beard and didn't tell me, I didn't feel like I was on his team. This is embarrassingly petty, but it felt like he wasn't getting enough attention from me and therefore needed to get it from work in a way that excluded me. Had he texted me a picture before work or told me what he was doing beforehand, it would have been fine. I would have felt privileged with the information. Instead, it felt like he deliberately circumvented me. \n",

I've been in your position before and when I called the police I was told it was hearsay and they couldn't do anything at all. Either way, I think you should call and find out. At least try before saying it would do no good, ya know?\n",

      "Even if that's true, why would you want to be with someone like that? He was pissed that you left for a few months to improve your career? I would be a little sad and miss my boyfriend, but retaliation? I mean, you guys have been dating for 3 years, right? So I'm sure you've thought about a future together. Why wouldn't he want you to take steps to improve both of your futures? He loves you selfishly. He doesn't want what's best for you, he just wants the love and affection you can give him. If he truly cared about your feelings, he wouldn't have tried to retaliate and do something that might hurt you. \n",

How can he even rationalize what he's doing? The fact that he's trying to hide this from you when it's so obvious shows how smart he thinks you are. Dump. him. He's cheating. If he even cared about you *at all* he would be honest. Or at the very least, the absolute bare minimum, he would stop talking to her without you prompting him to. He wants what he wants. When he doesn't get his way he retaliates. Do not date a guy like that. \n",

It must hurt a lot because from his side it might feel like she is disgusted by his behaviour. \"You cant even clean up - I knew what you did!\" His sexuality which should show his affection for his wife is now banned from their house, its censored and everytime he rubs one out he has to think about how he actually hide the fact he did it. Would you feel still attractive? I wouldnt if I cant even masturbate in fron of my girlfriend and I am pretty sure he cant if he has to get rid of all evidence so she doesnt get angry. \n",

      "He's 30 years old - he will never change. I can already see this being an issue in your marriage for the rest of your lives, and it will only make you more bitter/resentful as time goes on. I personally would high-tail it out of there because immaturity, lying, and stealing are deal breakers for me. If you insist on staying with him and working things out just know that this is how it will always be. He might get better for a while, but he will always fall back into bad financial habits and lying.\n",
      "You can't really answer the question of whether or not he is abusive (with the exception of physical types of abuse) by one interaction/event. Maybe there is something else going on and he's unintentionally taking it out on you? It's too hard to say from a single example like yours.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is **more** telling, though, is the fact that you are questioning it. This leads me to suspect that there may be other things which lead you to suspect this. Most people wouldn't start questioning if their long term S.O. of two years is abusive because of a single occurrence like this. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for whether he is being immature? Well, at 29 years old, I would certainly hope that instances of immaturity over petty disagreements would be minimal by now. If he acts immature about not getting what he wants over something like this, what is it going to be like when he doesn't get what he wants when it's something that's actually important? \n",
      "\n",
      "These questions are even more so important, right now, because you're not just asking them for **your** sake, you are asking them for your child's sake as well... so you make need to take some long, hard looks at your relationship and ask yourself some questions that may result in unpleasant answers.\n",
      "It'll take time. It sounds like you got quite close, and he didn't help by going on about how he much he liked you and wanted to keep seeing you - but then dumping you. He built your expectations up and then dropped you a heartbeat later, don't be surprised if the sting takes a while to fade. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to think about this - if you'd stayed together, this is a good indicator of how he would have acted any time you guys went through a rough patch. The pity party for himself, making lots of cryptic references to it online, sending you mixed messages about how he feels. That might not have been so great if you'd got serious with him - maybe you had a lucky escape!\n",

      "Yea I agree\n",
      "Just cut him off. Nothing good can come of it.\n",
      "Don't think in terms of \"having him sent home\". Think of \"trying to make him understand he is acting out and it is falling back on him negatively\". Send his parents an email tonight, say you need advice and ask if you can call them tomorrow. In your best interest, try not to complain as much as you're pissed off. Just tell them that it seems their son has difficulties adapting to the rules and that you feel it is your responsibility as the the \"host brother\" to help him. Then just little by little inform them of the way he talks to you and takes things for granted. Quite honestly, it's a major fuck up from your parents that they don't enforce the rules in their home so you have to be careful how you word this. His parents probably expect your parents to handle the \"educational\" part and if they don't, it'll fall back on your family. Maybe if you talk to his parents, you'll find out what pisses of your guest about living there. Try to be open and use it to gather information to find a win win solution for everyone. You'll be more happy with that than with sending him away. \n",

That's pretty unfair... if your SO who you don't have a 'till death do us part' pact decides to let themselves balloon up to the point where you're no longer attracted to them, how is OP being a jerk by deciding to move on? You just said that there's nothing he can do about it. So there's nothing he can do about it besides suck it up and suffer in silence or break up and be a jerk? Those are the options?

      "Good for you! You were very brave, doing things differently and going for the kind but firm approach. He sounds like he was doing well too. Be prepared to have to stick by yourself for a while. He may even escalate his former bad behaviors and you may feel like there is no chance, then when he realizes you really are holding firm, you'll have no more trouble. Yay you!\n",
      "You said you wanted to have the talk in person and he was at work at the time. He suggested a time when you can have that talk in person. Then asked you if there was an issue that needed to be discussed immediately. You said \"no\" and also indicated that you recognized he was at work and didn't need to talk about it via text so that was the end of it for now. \n",

      "That's a slippery slope argument though. Is it really too much to ask that he be discrete? Like I know my bf masturbates, as do most men, but it doesn't mean I'd want to see it all over the place. He's leaving a mess that she has to clean up, I think it's fair for her to ask that he do a batter job cleaning up after himself. There's nothing \"shameful\" about being neat and respectful about it. \n",

Our honeymoon phases of happiness and forgiving started to only last hours, and I lived for them. They seemed to be the only times we could be happy.

If I wasn't so stupid, so embarrassingly incompetent, he wouldn't have to yell at me, or tell me how much I was messing up. He'd always give me warnings that I needed to act fast to make him happy- he'd grab the sides of my back and pinch them. He'd glare at me. These were signs that I had about thirty seconds to make him laugh. Not smile, laugh. If I didn't, my day was going to be miserable. But he's pretty considerate; he would warn me.\n",

If you tell him you want to get married, you're just going to freak him out and piss him off! Eheu!

No ultimatums, no demands; I'd just like to know if we're on the same page about the subject and that it's going to happen sometime in the near-ish future, not in the anomalous Maybe Someday Possibly future. I'm not trying to be a bad guy here, but marriage matters to me and I don't want to be in a relationship where the possibility is dangled in front of me when he actually has zero intentions of following through.

I think that that is not unreasonable to expect.

Called him and checked up on him daily when he was dating them.

He's 6'2\" and has let teeny little 5'1\" girls beat on him, which angers me to no end to remember but we were both raised the same way: use words, not bodies. Period.

That's good and healthy and leads to awesome sex. You won't be able to grow sexually in this relationship- he clearly wants to make it all about him and what he feels like doing. Not okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Leaving is not the answer to uncovering an issue in your relationship. He put you in an awful position by asking the question. He is terrible at resolving conflict. Not something you want in a partner.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. All this \"you always have to be right\" stuff is just so off. Basically he knows deep down that he is being unreasonable, he has no idea how to argue his case because he doesn't have one. So he just tries to make you feel bad instead. Ugh. Awful.\n",

      "Also, here is a quote that is commonly ascribed to the Buddha (not sure if he really said it or not): \"Holding on to anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.\" That always hits me like a ton of bricks. I wouldn't be surprised if he really did say that! It's a very zen way to look at it. Actually, that's another thing you could do: study zen. I highly recommend The Way of Zen by Alan Watts. It's fascinating, and very helpful. People often think that zen Buddhism is a religion but that was never Buddha's intent...he was simply a philosopher, a man who wanted to be free of all the mental traps we so easily fall into. Including things like holding grudges. He postulated that there is a part of us that likes to hold on to hurt and anger and being slighted, and it is only when we learn to let go of our \"ego\", for lack of a better word, and stop letting it call the shots that we learn how to really forgive and not let things get to us so much in the first place. I still haven't read the entire book, and already it's been a huge help for me. It's heavy reading and you'll want to read it with a notebook and pen handy so you can write stuff down.\n",

      "**He killed an innocent creature**.   Sorry, but that right there is all you need to know.  He is abusive and things will only escalate from here.   Just to repeat- it's not because he is not good enough, it is because he is brutal and controlling.  \n",

It WAS you, and the only way you can truly change is by accepting that and fixing yourself. You have to change. Your behavior as it is now and has been is disgusting.\n",
      "I have known couples that meet young, are very compatible and end up together, married, and in their 30's of 40's doubt what they have because they have little or nothing to compare it against. Or they just wish they had had a more wild youth.\n",

Selfish love is when you love the way someone makes you feel, or what they do for you. Selfless is when you love them and want them to be happy regardless of their imperfections or flaws. He's happy and accepts you when you fit his ideals. \n",

Do you really want to have to hide your feelings because you don't want to be ridiculed for them? Your boyfriend is the one that's suppose to make you feel better when you're hurt, not make you feel like shit. The fact that his pride/ego/whatever is more important than your feelings is just not okay at all. \n",

      "1. Weight gain is something you can do something about, and moreover, something you may WANT to do something about for your own health - talking about it is not always a selfish preferential thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. It's also usually an alteration of something you were signed up for. Someone who started dating a 5'0\" 250 pound girl and then complained \"I wish you weren't so fat\" would be treated with equal distaste because that's what they started dating! It's not like you became tiny. You have always been 5'1\" (in your adult life anyway). It's weird that he spends time complaining about this.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. There is a big difference between loving someone who isn't necessarily your physical type and being aware of that, versus loving someone and remarking somewhat often (as it seems he does) on the fact that they aren't your type in ways they can't alter... E.g., there's a different between telling my boyfriend \"Oh yeah, I usually like taller guys\" versus \"Oh, I wish you were tall, I'm honestly not attracted to people who aren't\". \n",
      "\n",
      "I think you should talk to him and ask WHY he says he what he says. What does he hope you will do in response? Is he just saying it conversationally? Does he realize that it is hurtful?\n",
      "\n",
      "I second everyone else who says that your relationship isn't perfect if you can't talk about this stuff. Talking is uncomfortable and NOT always easy, but good communication is something both partners need to be dedicated to and invested in for the health of their relationship. It sounds like neither of you two honestly want to try at it, no matter why that is (intimidation or disinterest or whatever other reason you can think of).\n",
      "Using your things may actually be a big part of the masturbation for him... feeling closer to you somehow? I don't know, just as a way for you to feel a little more positive about why he is using YOUR things. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the rest... I do think that, like EVERYONE else here has said, you are combining feeling guilty for not 'giving' him sex, and that it makes you more aware of the lack when you see evidence that he actively wants it. \n",
      "I just wanted to give you some hope, CBT has a 60-80% long term succes rate, that is more than meds, (40-60%) and for some reason more than CBT and meds combined (40-60%) so if you have the opportunity to do this, take it! Succes rate, as in, not learning to cope, but actually be \"cured\".\n",

      "\n",
      "Whatever you will do to become better, you will have to work hard for it. There is no easy cure, I'm sorry. But what matters is, it is totally possible to become better. What will help you immensly is making all the right lifestyle choices, for example DO go exercise, what you do doesn't even matter, as long as you do it. Cut caffeine out of your life. Go outside regularly. Read every piece of selfhelp for GAD. Accept what you feel!! But don't let it drag you down! Succes man, you CAN do it!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I agree with you, especially that it is his decision and his only. I think it is the right thing to do, though, mainly because I would want to be told. \n",
      "Here's the thing. It's not actually him you like. It's the fake him he presented to you to draw you in. The real him is a lying cheating asshole. Why would you like that?\n",

      "Well I guess he thinks that she never really cared for the dog and thinks that he is replaceable. I can somewhat understand how he reacted. Obviously its a very harsh reaction but thats what loss can do to you: doing shit that is completely out of line. It would be sad if they didnt try to make it whole again and talk about in my opinion because it would connect the loss of the dog to the breakup which is just a really sad development.\n",
      "To add: Collect evidence of alcoholism and cheating so you can use it in the divorce proceeding. I know this sounds callous, but just do it anyway even if you don't plan or want to use it. At least this way you will have evidence if you need it.\n",
      "You can just type \"I don't understand mental illness so it doesn't exist\", that says the same thing. This guy has clearly had a complete break with reality. That is not how a functioning person behaves. Doesn't mean OP should do anything other than leave him, but he's clearly not well. \n",
      "Having lived with a mom who was prone to rages, I think you sound a lot more together than I was at that age.  Given that, I would recommend you set up a few appointments with a counselor, with the goal of working out a) exactly what you want to say, and b) how you want to say it.  Personally I'd invite dad to come to an appointment and say it there, but that's just me. Good luck.  You have come a huge way and you know where you need to go, but it's a scary journey.\n",

      "Your doctor's decision to override your emotional system has consequences that impair all of those motivations in both of you. If your counseling program does not find a way to fill in the gaps created by the short-circuiting of your emotions, then it is causing harm at a great rate. Your man is hiding his feelings from you because you two are not meeting on that common ground. He feels ashamed that you can't be happy being married to him, and the easiest way to counteract those feelings is to find a way to recover the sensuality he longs for.\n",

Then for nothing more than giving you a dirty look, you throw a drink at him! And he grumbles, one can only imagine how much frustration he must have felt after putting up with your shit for so long, handling this altercation as best he could, and having an alcohol drenched shirt to show for it, and what do you do?

For example, some people are just incredibly overly affectionate and others aren't as much. So maybe on his level you rank high up, but he doesn't have the capacity to feel as intensely about relationships as you do. If you can handle his independence it could work.

IF he is this type of person, until you give him a definite answer, he won't give up. In my experience, being honest with them doesn't help the situation. It just opens you up for attack. Probably the best course of action is to give the answer about it being personal and say maybe we can discuss it at a later date. If he keeps on it, suggest a different topic that you are comfortable discussing. As others have said, debating will go nowhere. Eventually he'll have to find out about where you stand, but hopefully if you and your boyfriend are still together, that will come out at a time when your relationship is stronger and you're both willing to stand by one another even if his dad throws a fit. Your boyfriend needs to get comfortable with his own religious stance before he can stand up for you and defend yours with you.\n",

He wants to be the victim, which is just wrong. He's pulling your strings like you're a puppet, and he's being verbally abusive to you. I say cut your losses and move on.\n",

He's going to have some problems trusting you, and every time you drink when you're not together he is going to worry.

You cannot freeze his credit and he can't freeze yours, but you guys can do it for your own credit, if that makes sense. idk how much trust you guys have with each other, but if you get him to agree, then YOU make the \"pin\" (see link) for his credit, so he can't just unthaw it and start the cycle again.\n",

When you date someone, you have to meet them where they are at, and be okay with what's going on in their life. If you don't want to continue this because you're that insecure about his friendship with this girl, then fair enough, that's your prerogative.

People between 18-25 change drastically.  Your brains aren't even fully cooked until 25 in most cases so a lot of changes can happen.  Whatever happened to him likely had nothing to do with you.  Take some solace in that.\n",

Other that separating from him, don't make any big decisions.  Live simply, focus on who you are and what you want.  Take it day to day.  You've got the right of it by exercising, talking with therapists, and getting tested.  Do some rebuilding on your self esteem too.  Small goals accomplished in quick succession will help build that back up.\n",

      "It's okay to feel hurt.  Own that pain and realize you'll be living with it a while.  Don't think you have to put it away or ignore it to get better.  You'll be able to realize how to heal once you understand what about this makes you hurt, and the only way to do that is to hurt.  Give yourself time to do that.  But also ask for help.  Your dad seems to be supportive, make sure you accept help from friends, let them take you out, let them be there for you.

Let's say it's true...not telling your fiancé about this and going over to the \"crazy landlord's\" apartment once in a while so as not to upset her is pretty dumb. He did not handle this well.

Also, because he never told anyone about this, there is no record corroborating his story about the landlord. All he has are some videos which probably can't definitively tell the whole story. They are certainly open to interpretation.\n",

      "To be honest, OP's fiancé getting a lawyer could be a rouse. It's possible he was sleeping with his landlord and filming it either with or without her permission. The videos he showed OP corroborate his story to an extent, but he had ample time to remove ones he didn't want OP to see. But his story is pretty detailed and does explain a lot.

Maybe the problem is that you and him consider intimacy differently? For most of the guys I know, intimacy is sex. All that romantic stuff and dinner and such is nice but... they don't feel like they are being intimate unless they get sex. It sounds like you basically want to cut him off for the foreseeable future (maybe I'm reading it wrong?), and he is reacting just like you would if he said \"Sorry OP, but I'm just really stressed. So I'm gonna stop making dinner and cleaning around the house and listening to you gripe about school and the kids for the foreseeable future. No more texting. Don't cuddle with me, I don't like it.

Unfortunately, I just don't feel like sexytimes when I'm stressed and busy. Can we work something out?\" See what he says about that, rather than what he says when you just turn him down over and over. If he is still a jerk... well. You are with-holding sex. Try having sex with him, and then having the conversation when he can rationally think about it. Suggest that he wait up for you to finish studying if that is the only time you have. Weekend mornings send the kids somewhere. This isn't about him just getting off, this is about him feeling like you love him, and care about him and his needs.

It's no burden to do these small things, not when you love someone, so why should giving in to a request like that be a big deal? It shouldn't.

The longer you're with him the longer she's going to see someone treating others like this as being acceptable. Your child should have someone with her mother who doesn't lie to her (and who is in love with/attracted to her enough to not need naked pictures of an ex to get off). Kids are smart, and they learn a lot from what we do, how we act, and from the ways we feel about things. Don't let lying to others being \"ok\" be the lesson she's taught here.\n",
      "Obviously it is important that he cleans up after him - In this case its not even cleaning but just making the bed for example. Dont forget that your arent 5 years old just because youre a tad bit chaotic. Not everyone is all about order and tidiness and OP seems to accept that in other aspects of their life. This is obviously about the fact that she knew that he fapped and every discussion about his behaviour will be tainted by that.\n",
      "Glad to hear he's going into rehab. I was a therapist on a brain injury unit for several years.

If he's not interested in chasing other women, he's saying that he doesn't want to expend the effort of talking on the phone, texting, skyping, travelling to see you, all the things necessary to maintain a healthy relationship while apart. He'd rather just take care of himself, and then when it becomes more convenient (and when he knows he can get some on a regular basis again), get back together then.

At 15, kids in Germany often start acting out as they are trying to show that they are adults and not kids anymore. We have a lot more freedom here at this age. Kids try their first alcohol, first sex, the parents leave them on their own without a sitter for the first time so the first house parties and club experiences happen. You can purchase soft alcoholic drinks at the age of 16, get your scooter license and in school they start to use the formal way to address you (i.e. Miss and Mr). Then it's only  two more years until you're legally an adult and can drive a car and vote. Turning 16 and 18 in Germany are probably the two most important birthdays here as they mean \"freedom from parental oppression\". They don't mean that really but it's widely considered as such by children. \n",

      "Probably he thinks he is being sent away by his parents because they didn't want him around. There was probably a lot of fighting at home because he probably acted out. Probably he got drunk a couple of times, smoked, made friends with some older kids, did other stupid shit and the parents are trying to separate him from the bad influence of his group. He knows they sent him away at one of the most exciting times as a teenager (hey, he can legally drink and maybe get laid) and whilst he probably was excited about this at first (it's quite a prestige to go to the US), he probably was really pissed when he didn't end up in a major city he knew from the movies and realized that teenagers in the US live a much more sheltered life.\n",

You need to sit him down and have a frank discussion about how you feel and what you need from him.  If he's willing to hear you and listen, then maybe give him another shot.

Those are things you tell yourself to cope because you can't handle the enormity of reality, which is that your fiance is a child, fights like a child, has very little emotional maturity, shows little ability to control his emotions, breaks things in anger, says things he doesn't mean, does not listen to you, is closed off and unwilling to change, has little ability to reflect on his issues...\n",

Make it clear that you want him back, but you also know you did something that's truly damaged him and he comes before you and your needs right now. If you cry and/or guilt trip him into taking you back then he'll probably eventually break up with you. He should take you back because he wants to, not out of pity. \n",

      "Okay, I would like to just say something real quick: You're not going to always be the most attractive girl a guy dates. Unless you started dating a guy who's only had one girlfriend or something there'll be a chance that he finds his exes as attractive if not more. Running away from this isn't going to change that fact. Attractiveness is really subjective, so another guy might prefer you over a model. You're never going to be the prettiest women in everyone's (or at least the guys you date) eyes. It doesn't matter if you're a model with big breast, tiny waist, and a beautiful face. Some people are going to find you incredibly attractive, others not so much. \n",
      "\n",
      "My problem though is the way your fiance handled this. First of all, he lied to you about his ex. The fact that he didn't stop the conversation, but encouraged it, and lied to you about it is a huge red flag and not okay. His response to your questions were not good either. \"You really want to know?\" Really? It doesn't matter what he says after that because you know what he's thinking is going to hurt you. I think if you're insecure about yourself he might not be the best guy to help with that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mostly though I would be concerned about the fact that he lied to you and tried to get his ex to talk about how much she thinks about him. Relationships are suppose to make you feel good about yourself. If you don't think you're getting that here then yeah you can break up with him and find someone else. You have to recognize though that this isn't just a problem that will disappear because you start dating someone else. It might be better, but this is something you're going to have to work on too.\n",
      "You absolutely cannot make someone grow up. They either do it on their own, or they never do. There is absolutely nothing you or your friend can do to change this. It's entirely up to the person in question. \n",

I can imagine most people would be less likely to push a strong emotion onto someone when there are other people around.   That said, I don't think that his behavior in a group setting should sway your thoughts anywhere. \n",

      "From everything you've laid out here, I can assume he likes you as well.  Ask him out to get coffee or hang out at your apartment.  Be the \"aggressor\" if you will if you think that he is not going to make a move.  It's obviously not going to happen over night, but a few times of hanging out without everyone else around and he'll open up.  \n",

I'm sure he felt hurt when you left as well, considering he chose to keep you despite firing the rest of your department when things turned bad.

He's not stopping you from moving on with your life, **you're** stopping *yourself* from moving on by allowing him back into your life, even through texts and phone calls. Just not meeting up isn't enough, stop giving him openings and he'll stop trying to create them.

See him in public? Turn the other way and leave. Seriously, there's nothing so wrong with his actions that you should be asking is he going to kill me, but there's something wrong with you for continually providing him opportunities to be a part of your life when you say that's not what you want. \n",

I know this isn't what you want to hear, but it doesn't really seem like you have any shot at being the 'bigger person' here. If you care to patch things up, you should reach out to him.

I mean I hope the very best for you and your SO in the future but I cant stop thinking that this is just the beginning of a bigger clusterfuck.

So where are her good intentions and why does she even think that she needs to defend him like that and why doesnt he defend you? There is more about the whole thing and I recommend you to explore your feelings and behaviour before you spot all the problems around you - again in a healthy relationship there wouldnt be a situation like this and if I were you I wouldnt tolerate it but somehow now everything is fine again?

When he inevitably asks why, don't point out his flaws, just that this relationship isn't working for you anymore.  Do not get into him objecting and you overcoming his objections.  When that starts just reiterate once that it isn't working for you anymore and let him know that you won't be talking to him anymore. Then say goodbye and hang up.  \n",

Yes it's very unlikely but I would just want to be sure he's just a scumbag before doing anything regrettable.

Don't waste any more of your breathe as he was unwilling to do the same for you.\n",

You can add in a clause about revisiting this arrangement in 5, 10, or however many years. Or, if he wants to be in his child's life he can choose that. You can have primary custody. He can visit until he's ready for more. Whatever you decide - get it in writing from a lawyer. \n",

OP really fucked up - do you know how much it can hurt that your significant other suggests to replace your dog after days? I would be scared by my SO if she does something like that so soon because it really lacks empathy. They both did wrong but at least OP tries to make it right again and all you guys are trying to say is: \"dump his ass\". What a wicked attitude!\n",

      "\n",
      "I don't have a list of obligations laid out for him, I have reasonable expectations that I can rely on my partner to be present in our relationship for me the same way I am for him.

Now the choice is yours - suck it up and accept this is your life, or leave.\n",

We haven't been married long enough in my state to have any marital property, so he's not entitled to any of it. My father is a lawyer, so I don't have to worry about any lawyers fees. He doesn't have any money to pay an attorney. I will still be wary of his intentions. But this is one of the few things that I think we have under control right now. \n",
      "Honestly, I don't know why no one else has addressed this. Of course this is disgusting and alarming for you but he's not \"cheating on you.\"  HE IS BEING ABUSED, AND HAS BEEN ABUSED SINCE CHILDHOOD. If you care about him AT ALL you will address that issue.\n",

      "Whether your feelings are justified or not, that's how you felt, and they're just as valid no matter who or what you are, so don't apologize for that.  However, I can see how he could just be joking around with you, without realizing that he'd taken it too far.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It may be a good idea to talk to him and let him know.  Just be honest with him.  Believe you me, as a guy with a pretty large, maybe overwhelming, sense of humor, I'd prefer someone be honest with me when I've gone too far, rather than hate me secretly.  Guys like us typically don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, but since we're always playing on the line, we're bound to stumble across it sometimes.  I will always apologize if I notice it, or if someone talks to me about it.  Plus, you don't want to resent him for this and let it build and build.  These are the sort of things that come out in your first \"big fight\" because you've unknowingly held a grudge the whole time.  This kind of stuff likes to eat at you in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "And since we're being honest on the interwebs, you also need to realize that you probably *aren't* as unique a snowflake as you may think you are.  I've had that exact same conversation with almost every girl I know, give or take the guy thing, as that depends on the girl.

We've both said we love each other, completely platonically, and it's true. We used to be mistaken for a couple until I got with my boyfriend, because that's how we acted.\n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend is fine with it, he knows we're close but he also knows I think of him completely differently. That's where your boyfriend is going wrong. He isn't making you feel more important, and he isn't showing how he thinks of her differently to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds to me like he is cranky. My boyfriend can sometimes get very short with me when he's sick. Especially when I wake him up for something. It's not abusive, it's a bit rude but understandable if he's really sick and wants to sleep. It doesn't sound like he's keeping you there because he wants to keep you from family/friends, it sounds like he just doesn't want to drive.\n",
      "It probably makes him uncomfortable too. Marginal discomfort is  not an excuse. \n",
      "This is exactly what I was thinking. He sounds more like an observer than someone who willingly broke down his own marriage. He describes a lot of actions, but not once does OP ever talk about how either of them are feeling. Do you feel anything about this at all, OP? Do you understand or care how your wife feels? This is eerie.\n",
      "Yeah, no that doesn't count as being broken up. So don't beat yourself up over the fact that it takes you too long when you haven't had the chance to get over him yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's really normal and ok to feel like shit right now. The most practical advise I can give you is that if you want to drown your sorrows a bit more, to do it in a safe place or with other friends near who can do the bringing you home part. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also delete his number, or otherwise lock/hide your phone so you aren't tempted to reach out to him. No contact is really hard in the beginning, but if you try it for a few weeks, you'll see that it really helps a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't have to be a superhuman right now, just cry until you can't anymore. If you want to tell him things, write them down, and have a look at that in a few days, 10/10 cases you'll be happy you didn't send it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good luck hun!\n",
      "Okay, so I'm not saying what he did was right, but I think I can understand why he'd say that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like he's not comfortable with sex *at all*, so if they asked him he of course wouldn't want to tell them that he's doing something he's not comfortable with, right? It's like, if you're embarrassed to have sex you're going to lie and say you're a virgin. So he's grown up thinking that sex before marriage is bad, and still doesn't want people to know that any sexual activity is going on because even if it's \"okay,\" it's still taboo for him. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, he's still a guy. So if he says *he* is the one who doesn't want to have sex, then they're going to call him gay or something. That's just what those group of guys would assume. It's kind of a lose-lose deal for him.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is probably a better way for him to have handled that, but it can weird if you're around people like that who are clearly immature. If he's uncomfortable about sex most likely *they're* bringing it up, and he's just trying to say whatever he can to get out of the conversation but not have them think less of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: Also, if he's grown up thinking you need to wait for sex, he probably internally feels like girls should remain \"pure.\" Not that he thinks any less of you, but he may have subconsciously been trying to protect you from them calling you a slut or something. Like I said, he could have handled things better, but sometimes you're in really weird situations and you don't know what to do. \n",
      "That's not true. There are things I want that my partner cannot or will not do for me, and likewise me for him, but that doesn't mean we go elsewhere for it.\n",
      "that's because you've never met me\n",
      "Definitely, agree with everything you said. Fuck this guy, OP unfortunately married a selfish, fickle person that will go wherever the wind blows his hardon. He probably won't find lasting happiness, the way he treats people. \n",

      "If he makes promises to stop, etc when you tell him it's over, and if you decide to tay, then put some sort of spyware on his phone and computer so you can see what he's doing. If not, it will drive you nuts.\n",
      "But he could ask his roommate to not have sex WITH his GF. And being in underwear around is not sex, but it is certainly sexual.\n",
      "Is he annoying you or preventing you from having me time? If not, let him be. If he enjoys his job that much, he's lucky enough to have his job as his hobby. He doesn't sound as extroverted as you and that's okay.\n",
      "quite frankly, i don't see the problem. If you don't have a sex drive, won't have sex with him, and understand that he's going to have to jack off, what's the problem? you know it's happening. You don't have to clean up anything gross... are you normally a neat freak where everything needs to be in its place? if so, this falls under the \"everything else\" category of clean-up and you can discuss that.  If you're just getting uppity about him moving the pillows and leaving the laptop on the bed, get over it.  You deal with not having sex in your own way, he deals with it in his. At least he's not going elsewhere for it.  I could understand if he left jizz everywhere or if he didn't clear his search history.  For pillows and laptop in the wrong place? i say grow up. you've obviously being too sensitive. This poor guy is married and stuck masturbating for lord knows how long.  (no. i'm not trying to guilt you into having sex with him, but just consider how frustrated HE feels!)  Cut the guy some slack. \n",

It is no one's job but his.\n",

      "He cheated. I know you don't want to see it, but everything is *screaming* infidelity. He's hanging out, getting drunk with her alone. He was secretive about her. They've had a flirtatious relationship. **He's cheated in the past.** The fact that he has a history of this is the last nail on the coffin. **He cheated.** There is *no way* he could be doing what he's doing and not have crossed a line somewhere. Maybe they just kissed once and realized it was wrong, so went back to flirting. Or maybe they've been having a full blown out affair. Also, the fact that he gets weird towards her when you're around is huge. It says that he doesn't know how to act around her in a way that you would approve. If their relationship was strictly platonic he would act the same way around her alone as he does when they're with you. \n",
      "\n",
      "He. is. cheating. He's done it before, and he's doing it again. No matter how hard you try to deny it it's not going to go away. It really sucks but no matter how much you say to yourself that he hasn't cheated, it doesn't change anything. \n",
      "He very clearly wants a girlfriend, so I'd advise another clear boundary setting conversation where you make it clear that he toes the line or ships out. \n",

      "It absolutely sounds like you are done with the relationship but are in denial. You probably have everything you want - and more. But somehow you aren't satisfied. If this is the case you need to own up to yourself and face what harsh reality there is. Regardless of how much you hide it - your children will suffer and know something's up. If you really want to save it I agree with other posters - separation and therapy would be key, but I think you're just in denial of how done you are with the situation. You're only trapped in it if you want to be.\n",

      "\n",
      "I think that's also the part that makes it hard to let go. You could let the person who he is now go, but you also know who he can be, and that's a person who you don't want to let go just yet.  \n",

      "Why is he 7000 miles away?\n",
      "One thing I've learned it's that the likelihood of changing someone is very low. You and he sound incompatible on so many levels and no amount of you telling him how you feel will change that. Do what you want, but my advice to you is not to compromise on those things that are important to you. I'm a guy and I seriously need the same things as you. I would not stay with someone that was not emotionally and physically compatible with me. \n",

It is in this kid's best interest for his parents to intervene as best they can with this behaviour now. He's getting a bit too old for people to be tolerant when it comes to invading their personal space. The next person most likely won't be his brother's girlfriend, and if it was me I'd get the fright of my life!

      "I wish they would try to help him. But they're the type of people who like to keep their skeletons in the closet and save face. Lots of untreated mental illness, alcoholism, and he recently had a cousin who became a teen mom and no one acknowledged it until she was seven months pregnant. \n",

      "\n",
      "How about this: assuming you can afford it, when your lease is up, move to his neighborhood. Maybe even get an open apartment *in* his complex, since you say that's an option. He, in turn, can go to his landlord and point out that he is a long-term tenant who has (hopefully!) been a good tenant and always paid his rent on time, and would they be willing to offer him a 6-month lease instead of a year lease? If he can secure a 6 month lease, then you two will be much closer for those six months, your relationship will have time to mature without too much pressure too soon, and you two can move in together in your new place at the year mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Or, alternatively, you can see if you can find a place in his neighborhood on a month to month or six month lease, and he can ask his landlord if they would be willing to transfer a year lease to another unit in his complex at the six month mark. Then, when you two have been together a year, you can leave your place and you both can move into a new unit in his complex without breaking his lease. Most landlords will be willing to work with good tenants who have a good record with them.\n",

      "Point being, you have more options than you think you do. However, you should think very seriously about some of the advice other posters have given you.

In my opinion, marriage should only be considered after you both have proven your compatibility with each other on all serious issues. \n",

      "I'm not saying he should get a pass. However, if he did it intentionally to be an ass that can't be fixed. If it's because he's socially awkward, but is remorseful, *he can* work on that and find ways to make sure that doesn't happen again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never said the way he handled it was okay, but if it truly is because he froze up and just didn't know what to do that can be worked on. Even if he has to go to therapy to learn how to do with those situations (and be more open about sex since that's a problem), it's workable. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not saying what he did was okay, and I never said that. However, him doing it just to be impressive and disregard his feelings is different than actually be socially anxious/awkward/unaware, and they need to be approached in much different manners. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also said *if it was a pattern* (as in something that he's not working on/trying to fix and just letting it get the best of him) then yeah that becomes so much worse. If they talk about this and discuss the way he should have handled it appropriately, and he effectively handles situations like this in the future, then this situation is a lesson learned. Not a happy memory, but much better than a dick boyfriend who doesn't respect his girlfriend. \n",

      "He might not have said anything to OP because he was embarrassed about the situation and was hoping they would have *some* maturity to not bring it up. Who knows? You can't apply what *you* would do to how he truly should have handled it if he was socially awkward. \n",

      "If he can learn from this and make sure this doesn't happen again then I really don't think it's the end of the world. Is it a sucky situation. Yes. Does it suck he didn't know how to deal with it properly beforehand? Yes. Should it ever happen again? Nope, definitely not. \n",

      "However, we're human. We make mistakes. If he takes the proper actions to ensure he doesn't do this again (even if it means avoiding those situations outright for the time being) then I definitely don't think that's as bad as a boyfriend who's just like, \"My girlfriend's a prude hahaha!!!\" \n",
      "It's your life. You can do whatever you want to do. But, look, no one who loves you would want you to be alone to the point that you only focus on them and no one else.

No one would ask you to wait for them all alone.\n",

For example, the next time you get coffee, joke and say \"this time I'll actually remember to pay for it\", or \"I'm going to tip in the actual tip jar this time\" and smile. Make light of the situation. Plus, what have you got to lose? Good luck!!! :)\n",

Just give him some warning, say when you guys \"video\" each other, you would like to speak to him about something that has been bothering you. The worst that can possibly happen is you two break up. I'm not saying that will happen, i think the complete opposite, but if you don't express how you're feeling your relationship with him will just come to a stand still (if it hasn't already). To sum this all up, Talk to him, he is the only one who can make you feel better at this point. Hope this helps.\n",

      "As far as compromise, he should be willing to help around the house, especially with raising two kids. But don't make a show of vacuuming while he's playing video games.

Would you rather do the dishes or the laundry?\"\n",

Ask him for input when planning meals for the week. And plan to dine out once or twice a week, too. I think him refusing to eat ANY leftovers is odd and possibly a passive aggressive tactic, but if he continues to refuse, you can always freeze leftovers so you have something to heat up when you don't feel like cooking.\n",

There is no reason that someone should be that hurtful of someone that they \"love.\"  I have once admitted to my now boyfriend that I was afraid that he would turn out like my abusive ex.  He was upset that I would even think that way of him, but in the long run he knew what I was afraid of and made it a point to not act in ways that would frighten me and allow me to feel safe around him.  He and I have been together on and off for almost 2 years and we have yet to get into a fight or more than slightly irritate each other and even that dissipates quickly.  The behavior exhibited by your boyfriend is not ok, and if it were meant to be, there would be no trust issues and no reason for any of this.  You are FAR too young to waste time on someone that will make you feel like shit half the time.  Get out, have fun with your life, hope that he gets his emotions in order.

What I'm saying is that the abused partner could have done a myriad of other things. I understand the hurt, and the anger he must have felt but he is an adult. They teach us not to hit when we are in kindergarten. \n",
      "We were together for two years and it was really good before we started drifting apart. Not a messy breakup at all. I think he messaged me because facebook sent out a fake message with my face on it and he used to be very supportive of me, so that makes it even harder\n",

This is not something that is deeply distressing me, and honestly I'm more hurt over your whole reaction towards this. I'm glad you're remorseful, but at this extent it's too much.

He told me it one upped what he got me for Christmas (not really, but w/e), that it was nice, commented on how we needed to get it resized. But he completely ignored the fact that I handed him a ring. Admittedly, I didn't explicitly do the whole \"will you marry me\" song and dance, but I'd also told him months ago that I was going to propose if he didn't, and he told me to go ahead. We're not the mushy kind of couple, so I figured, heck, he wouldn't want a cheesy proposal anyways. He's not dumb: he knows what being handed a ring means, right? Nope. No dice. He liked the ring, but completely missed (or knowingly ignored) the meaning behind it. It's like if a guy handed you a bunch of flowers and you responded with, \"oh, how sweet! You're a really good friend!\" \n",

Neither answer is a good one. I spoke to his mother on the subject (I'm closer to her than my own mother) and that's what she told me: \"don't pressure him, it'll just piss him off. I'm sure he'll do it eventually.\" Honey, we've been together for five years, lived together for 3 years, and have a kid. I'm trying to be patient here, but I'm honestly offended at this point that it hasn't come up. I don't want to get married right this second, but christ man, at least let me know that we're moving forward. Long engagement is fine, but give me something, *anything*. He has no reservations telling me that things are great and he's very happy, but when it comes to marriage, suddenly he turns into a muted clam. It's eating away at me and turning me into this nervous, insecure trainwreck.

They'd been together for 2 years. He didn't want to do it, but she's also a *massive bitch* capable of making his life miserable, so he did it just to shut her up. So now everyone in the family expects me to be better than her and just twiddle my thumbs because my boyfriend is romantically slow and, well, we wouldn't want to pressure him, now would we? You're better than Massive Bitch Girlfriend, aren't you? And it pisses me off because no, I'm not. She's an awful person, but she got what she wanted because she demanded it.

Write out what you want to say to him, like how important honesty is to your relationship, and that you've heard he's in another relationship with a different woman and you'd like to hear his perspective on what's been going on. When practicing the conversation, imagine the things he might say to you, good and bad, and rehearse responding to him. If you need to vent angrily, it's better to do it before you have the conversation than during the real one. Get it off your chest and start practicing responses to even the worst circumstances with calmly controlled things you can say. Prepare for the fact that he may very well be in another relationship and it might be coming to an end, but also keep in mind this guy whose intentions clearly aren't good may be full of shit and trying to cause drama where there isn't any. After asking your boyfriend to please explain what's been going on, bite your tongue and listen to him talk. Don't cut him off, don't jump in, make a mental list of questions to ask when he's done if you feel them arise while he's talking, but let him say what he needs to say before asking questions. If you start to feel yourself getting defensive or emotional, just take a breather, maybe tell him you need to use the restroom or something, and take ten long, deep breaths (more if you need them) until you feel you're fully in control of your emotions again. If you feel like it's an oncoming storm, tell him you thought you were ready for this conversation but perhaps it's a better idea to have it later when you're less likely to get upset. \n",

Keep in mind going in he's currently your partner, and try to give him as much benefit of the doubt as you would want if the situation were reversed. If it's a genuinely good thing and he's a decent person, he'll understand your need to address these rumours you've heard and he'll want to set the record straight.

I then gave him examples of what he should say, and how much I would appreciate it if he simply verbalized it when he looked at me and thought any sort of nice thought.

I know that this may tick you off, but the very first thing that I see as a possible problem is although he's 22 and you're only 18, it seems like your maturity levels are flipped (you being a bit more mature than him). That being said, it wasn't very wise of you to try to kill yourself over this guy. Look, you're still a really young gal, younger than you'd like to believe, and you have your whole life ahead of you.

In addition, it's a lot easier for me or someone else to tell you to let go of someone because we aren't you and therefore don't understand it like you do. Nevertheless, I think that you deserve much better, and like I said, you're still young, you're still going to have a colorful life; but you need to keep going and stay strong. Don't let guys like him fool you into thinking that you're less than you are. Does that make sense? \n",
