## Abstract

Detecting biased or discriminatory language in so-
cial media spaces towards protected attributes (such as gen-
der, ethnicity or religion) is a laborious and subjective task,
often necessitating the involvement of human moderators or
computationally intensive neural networks. In this paper, we
provide a likelihood-based statistical approach to identify and
classify biased statements or comments in online communication
platforms. Our model offers a fast solution that can aid in efficient
content moderation, text analysis and annotation. Using word
embeddings and statistical analysis, we can figure out comments
or sentences that may contain certain biases that we may wish to
set apart. For instance, identifying whether a sentence revolves
around male, female, or perhaps none of them. To test the
performance of our model and validate the classification pro-
cess, experiments were performed on various publicly available
datasets, including the Multi-Dimensional Gender Bias dataset


## Features

- **Identify Biases:** Likelihood-based statistical approach specifically designed to identify and classify various
types of biased statements or comments related to different
categories such as gender or religion in language.
- **Annotation:** Can be used for content moderation, text analysis and annotation. 
- **Controversial Biases:** Identify biased or discriminatory language in so- cial media spaces towards protected attributes (such as gender, ethnicity or religion.


## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up and use our model to anaylze text on your local machine:

1. Step 1: Install all the prerequisites using the following command
```bash
$ pip install requirements.txt
```
2. Step 2: Choose and install a pre-trained word embedding model from popular options like Bert, Sbert, spaCy, or gensim. (You can also train your own word-embeddings)
3. You can use the example notebook in `src/examples` to analyze your own data with the **sbert_model**, Please feel free to interact with the two experimentation notebooks located in the main directory. You have the flexibility to choose any word embedding model that you prefer for your experiments. By exploring and comparing the results obtained from different word embeddings.

## Usage

By utilizing the model accessible through the `src` folder, you have the capability to detect textual bias within any dataset, while also analyzing the disparities between any two input target parameters. This functionality empowers you to identify and assess potential biases in the textual data, leading to a deeper understanding of how certain factors can influence the information present in the dataset.

```python
# Load the dataset
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("path/to/data")
```

You can use the following piece of code to annotate your initial dataset to classify comments in thre different categories, namely $c_1$ biased, $c_2$ biased or neutral.

```python
from src.wordbiases import CalculateWordBias
from src.model import LikelihoodModelForNormalDist

# Set two different target sets consitsting of words you wish to target
target_set_1 = ["abuse", "bad", "hate", "worst"]
target_set_2   = ["love", "good", "peace", "calm"] 

# Select a list of Focus Words (i.e words that may contribute to the biases in any given comment)
F = ["ADJ", "NOUN", "PRON"]

wbcalc = CalculateWordBias(target_set_1, target_set_2, F, computing_device="cuda")
wbcalc.process_documents(data, "text")
c1, c2 = wbcalc.calculate_target_embeddings()

wbiases, _ , biased_words = wbcalc.calculate_biases()
total_pop = [b for _, b in biased_words]

mu = np.mean(total_pop)
sigma = np.std(total_pop)

likelihood_clf = LikelihoodModelForNormalDist(0.05, 0.95, threshold_limit=0)
likelihood_clf.fit_total_pop(total_pop)

# predictions
preds = likelihood_clf.predict(wbiases)[0]
data["prclass"] = preds
```
