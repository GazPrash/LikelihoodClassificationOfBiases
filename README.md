# LikelihoodClassificationOfBiases
A likelihood-based statistical tool specifically designed to identify and classify various types of biased statements or comments related to different categories such as gender or religion within a given dataset

--Abstract--


Detecting biased or discriminatory language in so-
cial media spaces towards protected attributes (such as gen-
der, ethnicity or religion) is a laborious and subjective task,
often necessitating the involvement of human moderators or
computationally intensive neural networks. In this paper, we
provide a likelihood-based statistical approach to identify and
classify biased statements or comments in online communication
platforms. Our model offers a fast solution that can aid in efficient
content moderation, text analysis and annotation. Using word
embeddings and statistical analysis, we can figure out comments
or sentences that may contain certain biases that we may wish to
set apart. For instance, identifying whether a sentence revolves
around male, female, or perhaps none of them. To test the
performance of our model and validate the classification pro-
cess, experiments were performed on various publicly available
datasets, including the Multi-Dimensional Gender Bias dataset
